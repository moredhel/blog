I have just gotten back from an amazing two week trip to Dune du Pila! It is a truly amazing place to go for low-hours pilots who want to up their experience and confidence with their wings.

## The Journey

We left the Hague bright and early, although not quite early enough to catch the train. So we quickly decided to grab an Uber to the train station! Our train left from Rotterdam Centraal, switched in Disneyland Paris before heading on to Bordeaux.
