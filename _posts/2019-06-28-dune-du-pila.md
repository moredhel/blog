I have just gotten back from an amazing two week trip to Dune du Pila! It is a truly amazing place to go for low-hours pilots who want to up their experience and confidence with their wings.

## The Journey

We left the Hague bright and early, although not quite early enough to catch the train. So we quickly decided to grab an Uber to the train station! Our train left from Rotterdam Centraal, switched in Disneyland Paris before heading on to Bordeaux. It was a very pleasant and relaxing trip all the way down.

When we reached Bordeaux the trains down to Archachon had all been cancelled for several hours. We thought a large lunch and some time would fix our problems for us so we set off to the nearest restaurant that looked like it could scrape together some un-creamed vegetables. With full bellies we returned to the station, hopped on the train, then proceeded to not move for the better part of two hours! A fully loaded (in fact, marginally more than fully loaded. Think more standing-room only, with that too in short supply) train, marginal at best air-con and going on 10 hours of travel. It was not the best combination.

The last leg of the journey was still an unsolved problem when we set off that morning. We knew where the campsite was, about a 40 minute cycle from the trainstation. We also knew that neither of us wanted to walk that distance. Keeping this part brief, It was the first bus-route that I have come across that didn't exist in Google Maps (within northern Europe).

We finally arrived at Pyla Camping tired, hungry and ready for an early night. We grabbed a bite to eat, dropped our stuff off at our new home for the next two weeks then went straight up to the dune for a sundowner and assess what we had gotten ourselves into for the next two weeks.
